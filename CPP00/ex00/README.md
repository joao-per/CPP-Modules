# Exercise 00 : MegaPhone 📢
## Objective of the Exercise 🎯
The exercise wanted us to create a program that takes in a string as a command-line argument and prints it out, but with the following changes:
- All lowercase characters are converted to uppercase.
- All uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.
- All non-alphabetic characters are ignored.
- If no arguments are passed, the program just prints a specific phrase.

## Understanding the Components 🧩
### 1. The main Function: 
This is the entry point of the program. It takes in the command-line arguments and passes them to the megaphone function.

### 2. The megaphone Function: 
This function takes in a string and prints it out, but with the changes mentioned above.

## How It Works 🛠️
### 1. The main Function:
When the program is run, the main function does the following:
- Checks if there are any arguments passed to the program. If there are, it passes them to the megaphone function.
- Returns 0 to indicate that the program ran successfully.

## In Simple Terms 🎓
Imagine you're a teacher, and you want to get your students' attention. You could just say, "Hey, everyone!" But that's not very exciting, is it? So, you decide to use a megaphone to make your voice louder. Now, you can say, "HEY, EVERYONE!" and get everyone's attention.
