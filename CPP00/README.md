# C++: Basics and Beyond ðŸš€ðŸ“–ðŸ“ž
In this foundational C++ module, we set our sights on understanding core principles of the language. From amplifying voices with the Megaphone to managing contact details and bank transactions, each exercise presented a unique challenge and a lesson.

## Overview of Exercises ðŸ“œ
### [1. Megaphone ðŸ“¢](https://github.com/joao-per/CPP-Modules/tree/master/CPP00/ex00)
Objective: Convert given strings to uppercase.

String Manipulation: A beginner-friendly dive into basic string operations and output formatting in C++.

### [2. Phonebook ðŸ“ž](https://github.com/joao-per/CPP-Modules/tree/master/CPP00/ex01)
Objective: Implement a rudimentary contact management system.

Data Handling: The exercise brought forward the concepts of storing and retrieving structured data, while also introducing basic data sanitization.
UI/UX: While the UI was simple, it highlighted the importance of user-friendly displays, especially when dealing with tables of data.

### [3. Account ðŸ’°](https://github.com/joao-per/CPP-Modules/tree/master/CPP00/ex02)
Objective: Manage bank account operations and showcase the transaction history.

Class Structure: A deeper foray into Object-Oriented Programming, focusing on encapsulation and data management.
