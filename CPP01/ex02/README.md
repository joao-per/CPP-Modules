# Exercise 02 : Brain
## Objective of the Exercise 🎯
The goal here is to explore the world of references in C++ and observe how they relate to pointers. References are a feature of C++ that allows one variable to reference another, without using a pointer directly. It's a way of giving another name to a variable. This exercise aims to help demystify the concept of references.

## Components of the Exercise 🧩
1. String Variable: A simple string variable holding the value "HI THIS IS BRAIN".

2. Pointer (stringPTR): This is a traditional pointer that holds the memory address of our string.

3. Reference (stringREF): This is the 'new' thing here. A reference is an alias, or another name, for a variable. It doesn't hold a memory address in the way a pointer does; instead, any operations on it directly affect the original variable.

## What the Program Will Display 🛠️
1. 📍 Memory Addresses:

- The memory address of the string variable.
- The memory address held by stringPTR.
- The memory address held by stringREF (which will be the same as the string's address since the reference is just an alias).

2. 📜 String Values:

- The value of the string variable.
- The value pointed to by stringPTR.
- The value pointed to by stringREF (which will again be the value of the string since the reference is an alias).

## In Simple Terms 🎓
Imagine you have a house 🏠 with an address.

The string variable is like the house itself, and its content ("HI THIS IS BRAIN") is like the people living inside.

The pointer (stringPTR) is like a piece of paper 📝 where you've written down the house's address. If you read the paper, you know where the house is located, and you can find out who lives inside.

The reference (stringREF) is like giving a nickname to your house 🏡✨. So, instead of saying "the house at this particular address", you might just say "Brain's Place". When you refer to "Brain's Place", you're directly talking about your house. There's no middleman, like the paper in the pointer example.

##### With this exercise, you're essentially doing three things:

Reading the address of your house.
Reading the address from a piece of paper.
Confirming that "Brain's Place" is indeed your house by checking its address and the people living inside.
The conclusion? References (like our nickname) are directly tied to the variable they refer to, making them a powerful and direct way to interact with variables in C++. They offer a different way to look at and interact with data compared to pointers.
