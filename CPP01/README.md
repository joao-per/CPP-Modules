# C++ Module: Bringing Life (and Afterlife) to Code 🎉🧠🧟‍♂️
In this C++ module, we dived deep into various concepts, from the eeriness of Zombies to the quirks of Harl. Each exercise provided an avenue to explore and understand different aspects of C++, from memory management to file manipulations.

## Overview of Exercises 📜
### 1. Zombie & ZombieHorde 🧟
Objective: To animate Zombies, have them introduce themselves, and manage their life cycle.

Zombie Class: Our blueprint to create individual zombies.
ZombieHorde: A terrifying force that spawns multiple zombies at once.

### 5. Harl & HarlFilter 🗣️
Objective: Create an automated system for Harl, the ever-complaining entity, and filter his complaints.

Harl Class: Uses pointers to member functions to manage various complaint levels.
HarlFilter: Allows filtering complaints based on levels using the switch statement.
